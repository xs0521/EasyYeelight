## Download

The latest official **installers** and **portable versions** for macOS can be found at [Github Releases](https://github.com/xs0521/EasyYeelight/releases) page.

## Install

#### Application Signing

*EasyYeelight* is not signed (due to its costs) so you will need to use a workaround for the first run. The workaround depends on if you're running an Intel or Apple Silicon chip.

- **Intel Chips**: [Open a Mac app from an unidentified developer](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac).
- **Apple Chips**: Open a terminal and run this command:

```
    sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/EasyYeelight.app
```
